## Changes
### All New, Custom Code
NerdÂ³ Bot has been rebuilt from scratch, using [Liara by Pandentia](https://github.com/Thessia/Liara) as a base. This means all functions have been rewritten by DerpyChap and lolPants so they all play nicely with each other, and hopefully will mean new features can be added much more easily than before. Essentially, the code is less shit now. *(Remember, you can make a new issue on our [bot issue tracker](https://github.com/nerdcubed-community/n3bot-issues) for any feature requests.)*

### New Help Command
The help command now looks somewhat presentable this time! It uses embeds to help lay out information much better than before, and now features links to everything NerdÂ³ related. _Isn't that neat?!_

`!help <command>` has also had a facelift with embeds.

Disclaimer: `!help` will not help with the following:
* Your homework
* Your siblings
* Your terrible cooking

### Channel Join and Leave
Sadly the days of `!owo` are over (sorry, weebs). Due to internal reworking of how this command system worked, the new commands to join and leave channels is now `!join <channel>` and `!leave <channel>`.  
You can do `!join` with no arguments to see a list of all channels you can join.

### User Info Command
`!userinfo` has had some changes done to it to tidy it up somewhat, including coloured status indicators and support for new status types. Now it's even easier to spy on other users!

### XKCD Command
The popular webcomic by Randall Munroe has made it to `#tech-talk`. Simply do `!xkcd` to fetch a random webcomic.

You can also do `!xkcd <words>` to search for a relevant XKCD.

Relevant XKCD: https://www.xkcd.com/1172/

### O Rly Books (and generator)
Another addition to `#tech-talk`, the O Rly parody book set. Doing `!orly` will pull a random parody cover from [/r/orlybooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/orlybooks/).

You can also do `!orlygen` to generate your own. For more info on this, use `!help orlygen`.

*We recommend checking out [this book](https://safe.n3s.co/kGr9i2q6.png).*

### Remind Me
Forgot to do that thing? Well, now we have `!remindme` to help with your forgetful ways. If you've used RemindmeBot on Reddit this command should seem very familiar.

Example Usage: `!remindme 1 hour Do the thing.`  
You can also react to someone else's reminders to also get notified when the time is up.

This doesn't work if you forget to do `!remindme`, we're not mind readers.

## Coming Soonâ„¢
### YouTube Alerts
~~This has been broken in the old bot for ages now, but a fix is on it's way. We wanted to launch the rest of the bot first though. Hopefully the fix will come quicker than the new site .-.~~

Hey, it only took us 6 months but YouTube Alerts should now work about as well as the NerdÂ³ website.

### Trivia
Due to the complexity of the trivia game, we've had to delay it until the core features are done. Sorry lol Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

### Reaction Polls
Same reason as Trivia.

### Rock Paper Scissors
Same reason as Trivia. *(We're busy folks OK, your dumb commands can wait)*
